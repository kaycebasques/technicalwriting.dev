This post continues my exploration into how docs strategy might need to adjust
in order take full advantage of generative AI. In this post I respond to Tom Johnson's
[10 principles for writing for AI], one by one.

(I ran this post idea by Tom and he heartily encouraged it. He has not
reviewed the content. Hopefully it's clear from my tone that I respect Tom and
intend for this post to be a friendly and professional discussion of important
ideas. It's more fun to figure this stuff out together through dialogue!)

## Disclaimers & disclosures

These are early ideas. I am not an AI expert. I have only prototyped AI-powered
documentation features. This space is moving quickly; therefore this post may be
irrelevant in a year. Tom and I both work at Google as technical writers but we
do not work on anything together. Google of course is heavily invested in AI but
everything in the post is completely my own view only. I am completely basing my
ideas off of open source work that others are doing (like [Supabase Clippy]).

## We only have potential principles right now

This might sound like a bit of a nitpick but it's not. I'll explain why in a moment.
At this early stage, there aren't actually any principles for writing for AI. We collectively
have not figured them out yet. Only when we have a lot of rigorous evidence and methodology
can we call something a principle. For now, we just have hypotheses about potential principles.
Based on the quote from Tom below it's clear that he's also talking about possibilites
and is not claiming that these are tried-and-true:

> How do you write your documentation to be consumed by an AI? While I’m not an expert,
  and many are still scratching their heads about how AI chats work, the responses from
  Phind, ChatGPT, and Bard suggest that the same principles of writing good documentation
  for end users might apply to writing for AI too. (Sorry for the lack of more authoritative
  research here—this is an area I plan to research more.) For now, I’ll speculate on a few
  best practices and the reasons for them. Here are 10 principles for writing for AI consumption.

I'm highlighting this idea because we (the technical writer community at large) will go farther
and faster if we openly share our "lessons learned" in a spirit of exploration and experimentation.
I don't know the answers. Tom doesn't know the answers. That's OK! Let's figure them out together!

## Responses

OK, let's dig in! Each section begins with the direct quote from Tom's post.

<h3 id="headings-and-subheadings">"Headings and subheadings galore"</h3>

> Chunk information into headings and subheadings to keep the information clear and identifiable.
  Subheadings help keep the writing focused and on point. The semantic tagging of headings with h1,
  h2, h3, h4 tags elevates the hierarchy and importance of the content, signaling to AI that this
  content is a high-level description of the section. Headings serve as a quick summary of what
  the information follows, thus reinforcing the summary of the content that it might spin up.

I think this is spot-on but for different reasons than what Tom mentions. In order for context
injection to work you basically need a database of your content chunked into logical sections.
All of the content in each section must be closely related due to how embeddings work.
See [A crash course on context injection] for a detailed explanation of my thinking here.
Rigorous, methodical use of headings positions your docs well for logical chunking.

Regarding "the semantic tagging... elevates the hierarchy and importance of the content...
signaling to AI" it's important to remember that LLMs are *weird as hell*. The way
they determine relationships between text is probably not the same as how we humans do it. I'm
sure that hierarchy factors into its calculations somehow. But remember that we are working with
machines with a different rhyme and reason than humans. SEO is sometimes in conflict with technical
writing because SEO practitioners are thinking about the needs of the search engine whereas technical
writers are thinking about the needs of the humans. Maybe it will be the same dynamic between
LLMO (Large Language Model Optimization) practitioners and technical writers. Our job is to find
harmony between the needs of the machines and the needs of the humans.

### "Semantic tags"

> Similar to heading tags, AI can infer information from semantic tagging. Is the information
  set off as a note, a blockquote, a code sample, a variable, a section, or something else?
  Better yet, does the information conform to the OpenAPI specification? Machines operate well
  when information conforms to specifications. This is why almost every CCMS is XML-based—because
  semantically tagged content you can manipulate programmatically.

I don't have any firsthand insights here but my hunch is that this will turn out to be correct.
The most obvious candidates to me are DITA, DocBook, and Schema.org.

Actually, I do have one firsthand insight. ChatGPT Plugins must conform to the OpenAPI specification.
See [The role of web service API reference documentation in ChatGPT Plugins].
Technical writers with OpenAPI expertise will probably see sustained or increased demand.

### "Code samples"

> Code samples are also a way AI can understand content, since code operates according to programming
  language rules. AI can infer the inner workings of a system by analyzing the meaning and syntax of the code.

No insights here. It sounds reasonable. For fine-tuning there may be increased emphasis on
[minimal, reproducible examples]. AI is all about prediction. Given this temperature, this wind,
this day of the year, what is the chance of rain? Temperature, wind, and date are
your inputs. Chance of rain is your desired output. Now, try to apply this same type of thinking
towards documentation. What are your inputs? What's your output? The page title and code block
could be your inputs. Whether or not the code builds could be your output. Or maybe the
code block should be the output? This is why I keep saying that applying fine-tuning to docs
is tricky. What are the inputs and outputs?

### "Fewer images"

> Images might be an anti-pattern for AI consumption and processing. If you’ve ever checked an image
  (a binary file) in Git and looked at a diff, you’ll see the gibberish-like code behind that image.
  Machines don’t process this code well, so if the documentation is visually based, this could lead
  to less AI processing and understanding. If you use images, add detailed captions below them.
  Additionally, any graphics, including buttons, should have a text label that describes them.

OK, now we can finally get a little spicy! I disagree with this one. We already have multimodal
LLMs that can input/output images. It seems like generative AI can handle images just fine.
If anything, I feel *more optimistic* about the future of using images in documentation.
Take for example the age-old problem of terrible `alt` descriptions. It breaks my
heart when someone puts an intricate diagram in a doc with a lot of important information
yet the `alt` description only says "diagram". All of the important information conveyed through the
diagram is not accessible to people who rely on assistive technology. LLMs offer the possibility
of auto-generating useful `alt` descriptions. I have experimented with this and have seen some
promising results.

### "Longer pages with context and modularity"

> Having more fully developed pages with sufficient context and modularity will help AI tools
  better understand the coherence of information. By context and modularity, I mean the content
  should be able to stand on its own, without supporting content (aka “Every Page Is Page One’’
  content models). Docs that are sharded into a hundred different topics connected through a
  JS-driven sidebar to expand and collapse the topics in various folders will probably be harder
  for machines to read, since the sidebar code might be more visually oriented to end users than
  machine-friendly. With this fragmented model, AI tools would need a thread weaving together all
  the different topics.

In [Positioning your docs to play nicely with generative AI] my hunch was the opposite. I thought
small pages were more likely to work well with generative AI than long pages for reasons related to
what I just said in ["Headings and subheadings galore"](#headings-and-subheadings). But now I'm not so
sure. We've been debating this in the Write The Docs Slack. Tom brought up the good point that
if you're providing a UI like [phind.com](https://phind.com) which shows sources alongside the
generated answers, then lots of small pages will mean having to sift through lots of results in
the sources UI.

I will note however that the comment about JS-driven sidebars only applies if the LLM is trying to
read entire HTML pages. That's now how context injection currently works.

Remember, also, that token limits are a constraint right now. You can only provide around 16K
characters of input to GPT-3.5. Will the situation improve? Surely. But still, it's a real limitation
right now.

### "Consistent terms"

> Consistent terms, especially matching the user’s query, are important in connecting the user’s
  query with the AI chat response. Although AI tools can likely interpret synonyms and make this
  connection, it’s better if the terms match.

Agreed. The inner workings of LLMs are profoundly statistical. It seems very likely to me that
using consistent terminology will make the LLM's job easier.

([Text Embeddings Visually Explained] is a very satisfying rabbit hole for building intuition
about the statistical nature of LLMs.)

### "Cross-references"

> Cross-references can enable AI to make sense of similar information. Cross-references help build
  a better web of information to power relationships through a semantic connection. AIs work
  fundamentally by prediction, by associating the most likely way to fill in the blank. Cross-references
  help associate topics with each other, teaching AI tools that the information is related and similar,
  which then might lead to a collection of cross-referenced sources used for the response.

This is an open-ended idea so I might be misunderstanding what Tom is getting at. To me, this
sounds related to the fundamental problem of context injection: figuring out which docs content
to inject into the prompt. It seems like Tom is suggesting a manual process where humans explicitly
markup the associations between docs. It could work, but we already have another approach that
is easier to automate: embeddings.

### "Plain language"

> Sentence structures should be easy for AI to parse. This means avoiding long sentence structures
  or ambiguous constructions. Documentation that consists of clear, almost staccato-like sentences
  will probably be interpreted better, even if it’s not as eloquent. We might balk a string of short
  constructions, but the prime consideration in docs is always intelligibility. Plain language and
  short sentences are hallmarks of simplified language, and this will help AI parse the meaning of
  the documentation better.

This also seems likely.

### "More documentation, not less"

> Previous trends toward minimalism, with the concern that too much documentation might overwhelm
  the user, might not be applicable. More detail, more documentation, and more information seem to
  lead to better AI experiences. Almost all AI training involves an extensive set of data (the large
  language model). With enough training, the AI can more intelligently respond to the variety of user
  queries.

Strongly agree. This is what I'm most excited about. I'm sorry for the cliffhanger but it will
take too long to flesh out all my thoughts on this topic so you'll just have to stay tuned for a
full post later.

### "Glossaries"

> A comprehensive glossary can help AI explain confusing components. For example, if the AI says to
  “implement a recursive pattern,” but it doesn’t know what recursive means in the context of the
  application, the AI’s responses will be limited or potentially wrong. A glossary could allow AI to
  break down confusing language and jargon for users. It could also help with synonyms.

Terminology could be a great application of fine-tuning for docs. Remember, LLMs are prediction
machines. Given this text, what is the next most likely text to occur? Training an LLM on your
glossary and terminology seems like exactly the same thing. Given this word or short phrase
(the term), the expected output is the definition of the term.

Fine-tuning for terminology may not be necessary, though. As mentioned elsewhere, I am prototyping
an experience along the lines of [Supabase Clippy]. With context injection, the LLM usually infers
the meaning of the term correctly. For example, one time the prompt was `Ninja`. With context
injection the LLM correctly inferred that we were talking about the software build system, whereas
the out-of-the-box LLM reply (without context injection) assumed that we were talking about
the black-robed assassins from Japanese history.
