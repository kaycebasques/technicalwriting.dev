Docs for AI agents
==================

.. figure:: ./agents.png

How are docs for AI agents different than docs for humans? How are they
similar? Do we have to maintain them as separate docs sets or can they
be combined somehow?

This page contains my notes on docs for AI agents.

-----
Scope
-----

* I work on **developer** docs i.e. docs for software engineers. I don't know
  how relevant AI agents are for technical writers in other industries or
  domains.

* In this post I'm thinking specifically about docs for AI **agents**. I'm not
  sure that an all-encompassing "docs for AI best practices" exists. The way
  that we optimize docs for RAG-based chatbots (for example) is probably
  different than the way we optimize for agents.

.. _agents-overview:

--------
Overview
--------

As a software developer, your primary interface for interacting with an AI
agent is through a chat interface that's been bolted onto your CLI or IDE.
See `Claude Code`_ for the CLI case and `Cursor` for the IDE case. The
power of AI agents is their ability to use "tools" to act on your behalf.
For example, suppose that you need to understand the history of a file
in your codebase. With a single prompt like ``look through the git and
github history of this file and summarize the evolution of this file``
the agent will:

* Run ``git`` commands in your terminal
* Fetch the contents of all GitHub issues mentioned in the commits
* Synthesize the information with an LLM
* Write the summary to the specified path

This really works! See `searchtools.txt`_ and `searchtools.md`_ for an
example.

Also, see `Cursor 3-minute demo`_ to get the gist of the agent experience
within an IDE.

How agents use docs

Agent docs versus internal eng docs
-----------------------------------

As the meme at the start of the post suggests, my hunch is that "docs for AI
agents" will end up looking largely the same as "internal eng docs". 

What are internal eng docs?
===========================

These are the docs that engineering teams write for their own use. The goal is
to share knowledge and standardize workflows among the team. E.g. RFCs
explaining key design decisions of the codebase and tutorials explaining how to
build the codebase and contribute your first commit. In open source projects
these types of docs are often called "contributor docs".

Who cares?
==========

The current design of agent docs is steering us towards maintaining the
agent docs as a separate docs set. E.g. your agent docs must have a specific
name ``CLAUDE.md`` and the docs must be located at specific locations. I think
this might be a mistake.

For docs strategy, the most important question on my mind is this: do we really
need to spin up agent docs as a completely separate doc set?  They seem very
similar to internal eng docs. I worry that we'll end up duplicating information
across the two doc sets, which inevitably leads to discrepancies. E.g. the
internal eng docs say that you must instantiate objects via static factory
methods, whereas the agent docs say that it's OK to use constructors directly.

At this point your local AI enthusiast says something along the lines of this:
"No problem! We can use AI agents themselves to keep the agent docs in-sync
with the internal eng docs!" This sounds feasible to me, but I'm not sure how
much that will actually happen in practice.

But more importantly, if you think that `partial autonomy`_ is the right way to
build AI systems over the medium-term, then combining or colocating the agent
docs with the internal eng docs should be the default solution because it increases
the odds that humans are constantly verifying the agent docs.

Comparisons
===========

Over the next few sections, I compare and contrast agent docs versus
internal eng docs across various dimensions. The sections are ordered
alphabetically by heading, not importance.

..      - Important for accuracy and user trust; updated as needed, but may lag behind usage
..      - Essential, as outdated or ambiguous content directly degrades AI answer quality; should be kept current, as LLMs may ingest outdated info
..      - FusionAuth, Kapa.ai, llms.txt, Claude Code, YCombinator
..    * - Best Practices
..      - Focused, actionable, and clear documentation is recommended
..      - Rules should be concise, composable, and provide concrete examples; avoid vague guidance
