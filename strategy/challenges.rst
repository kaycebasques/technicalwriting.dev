The intractable challenges of technical writing
===============================================

There are a few widely recognized intractable challenges\ :sup:`1`
in technical writing:

.. _all the kinds of documentation: https://diataxis.fr/start-here/

* **Completeness**. It's hard to comprehensively document *all* new features
  in a timely fashion and it's hard to comprehensively deliver
  `all the kinds of documentation`_ that users may actually need to succeed.

* **Correctness**. As the system changes, it's hard to keep the docs *always*
  synchronized with the new reality of the system.

* **Discoveryness**. Even if the needed content exists, it's hard to
  *guarantee* that users will find it.

.. _supervised learning: https://cloud.google.com/discover/what-is-supervised-learning
.. _fine-tuning: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning

I have come to the conclusion that these challenges are not solvable with
the practices and technologies of the 2010s. To be clear, I'm
not saying that we should throw out the tools and practices from the 2010s
and start from scratch. They are a solid foundation. All I'm saying is that
we will never be able to solve the intractable challenges using *only* the
tools and practices of the 2010s. To make further progress on the intractable
challenges, we need to incorporate new tools and practices into our 2010s
foundation.

:sup:`1` Many people have discussed these intractable challenges over
the years. The most recent ones I'm aware of are `Riona McNamara`_ and
`Aaron Gillies`_.
