.. _decisions:

=============================
Focus on decisions, not tasks
=============================

A quote from `Every Page Is Page One <https://xmlpress.net/publications/eppo/>`_
that has deeply changed how I approach technical writing:

  In technical communication, we don't talk much about decision support; we talk
  about task support… In many cases, the information people need to complete their
  tasks is not information on how to operate machines, but information to support their
  decision making… simply documenting the procedures is never enough… What I am talking
  about is documenting the context, letting users know what decisions they must make,
  making them aware of the consequences, and, as far as possible, leading them to
  resources and references that will assist them in deciding what to do.
