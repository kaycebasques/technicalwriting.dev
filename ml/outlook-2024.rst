GenAI Outlook 2024

2024 Dec 31

Back in March 2023 I published :ref:`genai-outlook-2023`.
With less than 12 hours remaining in 2024 I have managed to keep
my yearly streak going. Here's my 2024 outlook regarding the
impact of generative AI on my field, technical writing.

Review of 2023 outlook

I just re-read :ref:`genai-outlook-2023`. Here's my current thinking
about the ideas mentioned in that post.

Automation and job loss
=======================

Back in March 2023, a lot of technical writers were worried that
GenAI would automate our jobs away. It was honestly a panic, and
there's still quite a lot of it in the technical writing circles
that I monitor.

Objectively, this has not happened yet. I am not aware of any
technical writers losing their job because their organization
managed to automate most or all documentation work.
