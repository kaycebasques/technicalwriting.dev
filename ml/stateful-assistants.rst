Stateful docs site assistants
=============================

2024 Feb 8

I think about the people reading my docs in terms of "journeys". Google Search
drops them into some random page of my site. The content they really need often
isn't on that exact page; they need to click around to a few other pages. Or
they're building something complex and the ideas are spread across multiple
pages. For a GenAI chatbot assistant thingamajigger to be truly helpful, it's
got to be a companion on that journey. "I can't carry it for you, but I can
carry you!" It needs to remember your goal, the pages you've visited, and the
things you previously said. Most important, I think this could seriously speed
up the time it takes our users to Get Shit Done. Bonus, if we can get logs of
those chat conversations, we (the docs site maintainers) will have a much
better idea about what kinds of journeys our users are actually going on. The
video below is a proof-of-concept that stateful docs site assistants are
possible.
