* :ref:`underrated`. Machine learning (ML) has the potential to
  advance the state of the art in technical writing. No, I'm not talking

  impact on technical writing is **embeddings**. What embeddings offer to technical writers is
  **the ability to discover connections between texts at previously impossible scales**.

  went.
