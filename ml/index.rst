* :ref:`underrated`. Machine learning (ML) has the potential to
  advance the state of the art in technical writing. No, I'm not talking
  about text generation models. The ML technology that might end up having the biggest
  impact on technical writing is **embeddings**. What embeddings offer to technical writers is
  **the ability to discover connections between texts at previously impossible scales**.

* :ref:`tasks`.

* :ref:`bookmarks`. Embeddings-related papers, projects, etc.

  the process of removing code from over 200 GN build files. Here's how it
  went.
