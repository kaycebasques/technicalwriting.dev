# Tutorial: microbit

The `microbit` crate provides a **Rust-based** environment for programming the BBC micro:bit. It acts as an *operating system* providing tools to interact with the micro:bit's hardware, such as the LED display, buttons, and sensors. It includes abstractions to simplify hardware interactions.
