# Chapter 2: Board struct

Following our introduction to the `microbit` and `microbit-v2` crates in [microbit V1 and V2 Crates](1.md), this chapter delves into the `Board` struct, a cornerstone abstraction that simplifies micro:bit firmware development.

## Motivation: Centralized Hardware Access

Imagine you're building a weather station application for your micro:bit. You need to access various peripherals like the temperature sensor, humidity sensor (if you add one!), the LED display, and the buttons. Without a centralized approach, you'd have to manage each peripheral individually, leading to verbose and potentially error-prone code.

The `Board` struct solves this problem by providing a single, unified point of access to all the micro:bit's peripherals and pins. It encapsulates the complexities of initializing and managing these hardware components, allowing you to focus on the application logic.

**Use Case:** Let's say you want to display the temperature reading on the LED matrix.  The `Board` struct makes this straightforward by providing access to both the temperature sensor (through I2C, SPI, or ADC, depending on the sensor) and the `display`.

## Key Concepts

1.  **Peripheral Aggregation:** The `Board` struct groups all the micro:bit's peripherals into a single struct. This includes the display, buttons, accelerometer, radio (Bluetooth), and GPIO pins.

2.  **Initialization:** The `Board::new(p, cp)` function initializes the board. It takes the peripherals (`p`) and core peripherals (`cp`) as arguments, which are obtained from the `nrf51-hal` (for V1) or `nrf52833-hal` (for V2) crates. This function performs the necessary hardware initialization steps, such as clock setup and pin configuration.

3.  **High-Level Interface:** The `Board` struct exposes a high-level interface for interacting with the micro:bit's features.  For example, you can access the LED display through `board.display`, the buttons through `board.buttons`, and individual pins through `board.pins`.

## Using the Board Struct

Let's illustrate how to use the `Board` struct with a simple example: toggling an LED using one of the buttons.

```rust
#![no_std]
#![no_main]

use panic_halt as _; // panic handler

#[cfg(feature = "v1")]
use microbit::{Board, hal::prelude::*, hal::gpio::Level};

#[cfg(feature = "v2")]
use microbit_v2::{Board, hal::prelude::*, hal::gpio::Level};

use cortex_m_rt::entry;

#[entry]
fn main() -> ! {
    #[cfg(feature = "v1")]
    let mut board = {
        let peripherals = microbit::hal::pac::Peripherals::take().unwrap();
        let core_peripherals = cortex_m::Peripherals::take().unwrap();
        Board::new(peripherals, core_peripherals)
    };

    #[cfg(feature = "v2")]
    let mut board = {
        let peripherals = microbit_v2::hal::pac::Peripherals::take().unwrap();
        let core_peripherals = cortex_m::Peripherals::take().unwrap();
        Board::new(peripherals, core_peripherals)
    };

    // Get a handle to button A
    #[cfg(feature = "v1")]
    let button_a = board.buttons.button_a;

    #[cfg(feature = "v2")]
    let button_a = board.buttons.button_a;

    // Configure the LED pin as output.
    #[cfg(feature = "v1")]
    let mut led_pin = board.display.col1;

    #[cfg(feature = "v2")]
    let mut led_pin = board.led_matrix.col1;

    loop {
        // Check if button A is pressed.
        if button_a.is_low().unwrap() {
            // Toggle the LED.
            if led_pin.is_high().unwrap() {
                led_pin.set_low().unwrap();
            } else {
                led_pin.set_high().unwrap();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

*Explanation:*

1.  The `Board::new(peripherals, core_peripherals)` function initializes the `Board` struct. We obtain the `peripherals` and `core_peripherals` using the `take()` method, ensuring that they are only initialized once.
2.  `board.buttons.button_a` provides direct access to the button A peripheral through the `Board` struct.
3.  `board.display.col1` (V1) or `board.led_matrix.col1` (V2) similarly exposes the LED pin.
4.  The code then enters a loop, checking the state of button A and toggling the LED accordingly. The `is_low()` and `is_high()` calls read the GPIO state. The `set_high()` and `set_low()` writes the GPIO state.

*Example Input/Output:* Pressing button A will toggle the LED on and off. Releasing button A will do nothing.

## Internal Implementation

The `Board` struct acts as a central hub, delegating calls to the appropriate peripheral drivers. Let's break down what happens when `Board::new()` is called.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User Code
    participant Board::new()
    participant HAL (nrf51-hal or nrf52833-hal)
    participant Peripheral Drivers (display, buttons, etc.)

    User Code->>Board::new(): Call Board::new(p, cp)
    Board::new()->>HAL: HAL::gpio::Parts::new(p0, p1) (Initialize GPIO pins)
    HAL-->>Board::new(): Return GPIO pin instances
    Board::new()->>Peripheral Drivers: Initialize display, buttons, etc., using GPIO pins and other peripherals
    Peripheral Drivers-->>Board::new(): Return initialized driver instances
    Board::new()->>User Code: Return Board struct with initialized peripherals
```

*Explanation of Sequence Diagram:*

1.  User code calls the `Board::new()` function, passing in the peripherals and core peripherals.
2.  `Board::new()` initializes the GPIO pins using `HAL::gpio::Parts::new()`.
3.  `Board::new()` then initializes the peripheral drivers (display, buttons, etc.), passing in the appropriate GPIO pins and other peripherals.
4.  The peripheral drivers return initialized instances.
5.  `Board::new()` returns the `Board` struct, containing all the initialized peripherals.

Now, let's look at the code again, but this time focusing on the `Board::new()` function.  This example is taken from `microbit-v2/src/lib.rs`, but the structure is similar for V1.

```rust
impl Board {
    pub fn new(peripherals: hal::pac::Peripherals, core_peripherals: hal::pac::CorePeripherals) -> Self {
        // Implementation details for initializing the board
        // (clock setup, peripheral configuration, etc.) are omitted here
        // ...
        let pins = hal::gpio::Parts::new(peripherals.P0, peripherals.P1);

        let display = display::Display::new(pins.p0_13.degrade(), pins.p0_14.degrade(), pins.p0_15.degrade(), pins.p0_16.degrade(), pins.p0_19.degrade(), pins.p0_20.degrade(), pins.p0_21.degrade(), pins.p0_22.degrade());

        let buttons = buttons::Buttons::new(pins.p0_14.degrade(), pins.p0_23.degrade());

        let i2c1 = i2c::I2c1::new(peripherals.TWIM1, pins.p0_12, pins.p0_11);

        let accelerometer = accelerometer::Accelerometer::new(i2c1);

        let speaker = speaker::Speaker::new(pins.p0_00.degrade());

        let adc = adc::ADC::new(peripherals.SAADC, core_peripherals);

        Board {
            display,
            buttons,
            accelerometer,
            i2c1,
            speaker,
            pins,
            adc,
        }
    }
}
```

*Explanation:*

1.  The `hal::gpio::Parts::new()` function creates a `Parts` struct containing all the available GPIO pins, consuming the `P0` and `P1` peripherals. You can explore the [GPIO Module](4.md) in a later chapter for more information on GPIO.
2.  The `display::Display::new()` function initializes the LED display, taking the appropriate GPIO pins as arguments. The `degrade()` call converts the pin types to a more generic type, allowing them to be used by the display driver.
3.  Similarly, the `buttons::Buttons::new()` function initializes the buttons, and so on for other peripherals.
4.  Finally, a `Board` struct is created with all the initialized peripherals and returned.

The `Board` struct greatly simplifies access to hardware components, allowing higher level software modules to interact with hardware in a simpler way. For example, the [Non-Blocking Display](3.md) can be made using the `Board` struct.

## Conclusion

In this chapter, you learned about the `Board` struct, its purpose, and how it centralizes access to the micro:bit's peripherals. You saw how to initialize the `Board` struct and use it to interact with the LED display and buttons.  This knowledge will be crucial as you delve deeper into the `microbit` codebase.

In the next chapter, we will explore the [Non-Blocking Display](3.md), building upon your understanding of the `Board` struct.
