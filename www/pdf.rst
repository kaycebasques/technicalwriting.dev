This works on Google Chrome for Linux and Firefox for Linux. Haven't tested
other browser/OS combinations.

Just append ``#page=X`` to your URL, where ``X`` is a placeholder for
the page you want to link to. For example, the following link should
jump you to page 70 of the Raspberry Pi Pico getting started guide. You should
see a section titled ``Debug with a second Pico``:
https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf#page=70
