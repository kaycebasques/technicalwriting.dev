Links

* :ref:`link-text-automation`. A killer feature from Sphinx that more docs systems
  should adopt.

* :ref:`pdf`. Just append ``#page=X`` to your URL, where ``X`` is a placeholder
  for the page you want to link to.

* :ref:`intertwingularity`. Iâ€™m building a web crawler so that I can track how pages in my docs
  site link to each other and to the outside web more broadly. If a lot of my docs pages link to
  some particular page, then that page is probably important.
