Boots-on-the-ground reporting from the frontier(s?) of technical writing.

---------------
User experience
---------------

* :ref:`methodology`. Background context for my field research.
* :ref:`searchboxes`. Where should I put the search box on my docs site?
  What placeholder text should it contain? What should happen when I type stuff
  into it? What should the search results look like?

----------------
Machine learning
----------------

* :ref:`stateful-assistants`. GenAI chatbot assistants might be very useful if
  they can serve as companions for the entire journey that readers take when
  visiting my docs sites.
* :ref:`evals`
* :ref:`playing-nicely`
* :ref:`plugins`
* :ref:`principles`
* :ref:`genai-outlook-2023`. My initial thoughts on how GenAI might affect
  technical writing.

           Hello! My name is <a href="https://kayce.basqu.es">Kayce</a> but you
           can call me... Kayce... I've been a professional technical writer
           for ~12 years. I got my start at a ~10-person internet of things
           startup, building out all their docs and docs-as-code infra. After 3
           years there I moved on to Google's Web DevRel team. Noteworthy
           experiences from that role include writing all the original
           Lighthouse docs, doing all DevRel for Chrome DevTools (docs, videos,
           conferences, support, etc.), and being content lead for web.dev and
           developer.chrome.com. After 6 years on Web DevRel I took a 1-year
           "sabbatical" from work. Then I came back to Google, did a brief
           stint on fuchsia.dev, and finally switched over to pigweed.dev. I've
           been docs lead for pigweed.dev for over a year now.
