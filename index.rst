* :ref:`methodology`. Background context for my field research.
* :ref:`searchboxes`. Where should I put the search box on my docs site?

* :ref:`offline`

  they can serve as companions for the entire journey that readers take when
  visiting my docs sites.

* :ref:`plugins`
* :ref:`principles`
* :ref:`huggingface`
