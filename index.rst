           Hello! My name is <a href="https://kayce.basqu.es">Kayce</a> but you
           can call me... Kayce... I've been a professional technical writer
           for ~12 years. I started out at an internet of things startup,
           building out all their docs and docs-as-code infra. Then I moved on
           to Google's Web DevRel team. Noteworthy experiences include: writing
           all the original Lighthouse docs, doing all DevRel for Chrome
           DevTools (docs, videos, conferences, outreach, etc.), and being
           content lead for web.dev and developer.chrome.com. Then I took a
           1-year "sabbatical" from work. Then I came back to Google, did a
           brief stint on fuchsia.dev, and that finally brings us today, where
           I'm currently docs lead for pigweed.dev.
