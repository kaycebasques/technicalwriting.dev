* :ref:`methodology`. Background context for my field research.
* :ref:`searchboxes`. Where should I put the search box on my docs site?
  What placeholder text should it contain? What should happen when I type stuff
  into it? What should the search results look like?

* :ref:`stateful-assistants`. GenAI chatbot assistants might be very useful if
  they can serve as companions for the entire journey that readers take when
  visiting my docs sites.

           Hello! My name is <a href="https://kayce.basqu.es">Kayce</a> but you
           can call me... Kayce... I've been a professional technical writer
           for ~12 years. I got my start at a ~10-person internet of things startup,
           building out all their docs and docs-as-code infra. Then I moved on
           to Google's Web DevRel team. Noteworthy experiences include: writing
           all the original Lighthouse docs, doing all DevRel for Chrome
           DevTools (docs, videos, conferences, outreach, etc.), and being
           content lead for web.dev and developer.chrome.com. Then I took a
           1-year "sabbatical" from work. After that I came back to Google, did
           a brief stint on fuchsia.dev, and switched over to pigweed.dev,
           where I've been docs lead for over a year now.
