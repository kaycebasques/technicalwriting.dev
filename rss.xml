      <title>Understanding task types in the Gemini Embedding API</title>
      <link>https://technicalwriting.dev/ml/embeddings/tasks/index.html</link>
      <description>
        The models.embedContent method of the Gemini Embedding API supports a
        taskType parameter. This parameter lets you specify what kind of task the
        embedding will be used for. Let's try to deduce how this "task type" thing
        works.

      <title>Automating code deletion with Gemini (and a little Python)</title>
      <link>https://technicalwriting.dev/ml/gn.html</link>
      <description>
        I used Gemini 2.0 Flash and a little Python to automate the process of
        removing code from over 200 GN build files. Here's how it went.

      <title>Export Google Analytics data to Sheets via Apps Script</title>
      <link>https://technicalwriting.dev/analytics/sheets.html</link>
      <description>
        This tutorial shows you how to use Google Apps Script to
        export your Google Analytics data to Google Sheets. The data automatically
        updates every night. There’s also a custom menu item within Sheets to update
        the data on-demand. You can also optionally also expose the data over HTTPS
        to the public internet.

      <title>First impressions of Pocket Flow's tutorial generator</title>
      <link>https://technicalwriting.dev/ml/pocketflow/index.html</link>
      <description>
        Pocket Flow's tutorial generator describes itself as an AI agent
        that analyzes GitHub repositories and creates beginner-friendly
        tutorials for codebase contributors. With its default settings,
        the output from TCK was frankly unusable. It did not produce a
        tutorial, and the writing was not geared towards codebase contributors.
        BUT! With very little tweaking, I was able to get content that is very
        well-suited for codebase contributors. I was not able to get it to
        produce veritable tutorial content, though.

      <title>A tutorial on managing Sphinx projects with Bazel</title>
      <link>https://technicalwriting.dev/sphinx/bazel/tutorial.html</link>
      <description>
        This tutorial shows you how to manage core Sphinx workflows through
        Bazel. You'll learn how to: set up the Bazel build system, build the
        Sphinx docs, inspect the built docs, spin up a local server to preview
        the docs, add a Sphinx extension to the Bazel build, and deploy to
        GitHub Pages.

        A review of how much (or little) the ideas from GenAI Outlook 2023 have panned
        out, and a discussion of potential future trends in 2025.

      <title>The intractable challenges of technical writing</title>
      <link>https://technicalwriting.dev/strategy/challenges.html</link>
      <description>
        There are 3 intractable challenges in technical writing.
        I do not believe we will ever be able to completely solve these challenges
        using only the practices and technologies of the 2010s.

      <title>Embeddings are underrated</title>
	    <link>https://technicalwriting.dev/embeddings/overview.html</link>
	    <description>
        Machine learning (ML) has the potential to advance the state of the art
        in technical writing. No, I'm not talking about text generation models.
        The ML technology that might end up having the biggest impact on technical
        writing is embeddings. What embeddings offer to technical writers is the
        ability to discover connections between texts at previously impossible scales.

      <title>Exploring the intertwingularity of a docs site</title>
	    <link>https://technicalwriting.dev/data/intertwingularity.html</link>
	    <description>
        I’m building a web crawler so that I can track how pages in my docs
        site link to each other and to the outside web more broadly. If a lot of my docs pages link to
        some particular page, then that page is probably important. PageRank Lite, basically, except
        with much more focus on intra-site backlinks.

        Just append #page=X to your URL, where X is the page you
		    want to deeplink to.
