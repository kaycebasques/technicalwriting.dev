        A review of how much (or little) the ideas from GenAI Outlook 2023 have panned
        out, and a discussion of potential future trends in 2025.

      <title>The intractable challenges of technical writing</title>
      <link>https://technicalwriting.dev/strategy/challenges.html</link>
      <description>
        There are 3 intractable challenges in technical writing.
        I do not believe we will ever be able to completely solve these challenges
        using only the practices and technologies of the 2010s.

      <title>Embeddings are underrated</title>
	    <link>https://technicalwriting.dev/embeddings/overview.html</link>
	    <description>
        Machine learning (ML) has the potential to advance the state of the art
        in technical writing. No, I'm not talking about text generation models.
        The ML technology that might end up having the biggest impact on technical
        writing is embeddings. What embeddings offer to technical writers is the
        ability to discover connections between texts at previously impossible scales.

      <title>Exploring the intertwingularity of a docs site</title>
	    <link>https://technicalwriting.dev/data/intertwingularity.html</link>
	    <description>
        I’m building a web crawler so that I can track how pages in my docs
        site link to each other and to the outside web more broadly. If a lot of my docs pages link to
        some particular page, then that page is probably important. PageRank Lite, basically, except
        with much more focus on intra-site backlinks.

      <title>You can deeplink to a specific PDF page</title>
	    <link>https://technicalwriting.dev/www/pdf.html</link>
	    <description>
        Just append #page=X to your URL, where X is the page you
		    want to deeplink to.

      <title>Please support “skip to main content” on your docs site</title>

        I'm trying to become proficient at keyboard-only navigation and
        have learned that a lot of docs sites aren't friendly to people
        who rely on Tab...

      <title>Field research: search boxes</title>
	    <link>https://technicalwriting.dev/ux/searchboxes.html</link>
	    <description>
        Where should I put the search box on my documentation site?
        What text should I put inside the search box? What should
        happen when I type stuff into the search box? What should the
        search results page look like?
