`Intertwingularity <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertwingularity>`__ is a
term coined by `Ted Nelson`_, a computer pioneer who also coined the term
`link`_. `Computer Lib/Dream Machines`_ defines intertwingularity like this:

  EVERYTHING IS DEEPLY INTERTWINGLED. In an important sense there are no
  "subjects" at all; there is only all knowledge, since the cross-connections
  among the myriad topics of this world simply cannot be divided up neatly.

And this quote points at how links enable us to get closer to the
intertwingled nature of knowledge:

  Hierarchical and sequential structures, especially popular since Gutenberg,
  are usually forced and artificial. Intertwingularity is not generally
  acknowledgedâ€”people keep pretending they can make things hierarchical,
  categorizable and sequential when they can't.
