Field research: methodology
===========================

This page outlines how I approach all my field research.

----------------------------------------------
Bias for docs sites for computer professionals
----------------------------------------------

I'm paid to write docs for computer professionals, mostly software engineers.
My research is heavily biased towards docs sites for these people. The docs
sites for people in other domains are under very different constraints. I.e. if
you're not also writing docs for computer professionals, my research might not
be relevant for you. Over time I may try to sample docs sites from other
domains precisely because they might approach similar problems very
differently.

-----------------
Docs site "types"
-----------------

I aim to get a wide-range of samples from different "types" of docs sites.
The docs sites for code libraries, frameworks, CLI tools, programming
languages, and platforms are all under quite different constraints and
therefore often solve the same problem in very different ways.

-------------
Popular sites
-------------

I lean towards studying docs sites for products that I know to be popular. The
rationale is that these sites essentially condition us around what's normal
and what's not normal for a docs site.

-----------------------
Left-to-right text bias
-----------------------

I don't work on heavily internationalized docs sites and therefore I have
left-to-right text biases such as "the site nav is usually on the left".
