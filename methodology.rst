Field research: methodology
===========================

This page outlines how I approach all my field research.

--------------------------------------------------------
Heavy bias towards docs sites for computer professionals
--------------------------------------------------------

I write docs for software engineers. My research is heavily biased towards
docs sites for these people. The docs sites for people in other domains
are under very different constraints. However, over time I may try to sample
docs sites from other domains precisely because they might approach the same
problem very differently than docs sites for software engineers.

-----------------
Docs site "types"
-----------------

I aim to get a wide-range of samples from different "types" of docs sites.
The docs sites for code libraries, CLI tools, programming languages, and
platforms are all under very different constraints and therefore often solve
the same problem in very different ways.

-------------
Popular sites
-------------

I lean towards studying docs sites for products that I know to be popular. The
rationale is that these sites essentially condition us around what's normal
and what's not normal for a docs site.
